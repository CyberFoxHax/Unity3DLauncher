# Unity3DLauncher

A faster alternative to the default launcher. Literally opens in less that 1 second.
Projects will be launched with the -projectPath parameter bypassing the default launcher completely.
Put in the folder where all the Unity3D projects are contained and it'll enumerate folders with a depth limit of 5.

This will not bypass Unity3D's licensing system, if your license has expired you'll be promted by the default launcher no matter what.
This was the original purpose, for an offline experience, but even the personal license will only work for a few months until you have to enter credentials again.
